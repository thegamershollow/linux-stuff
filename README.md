# linux-stuff

This is a collection of scripts and other stuff for my macbook running linux.

### Why

This is a repo for me, don't expect software or other things for linux to be developed here, it's mostly to make setup of linux on my Macbook easier.

In addition to that, this stuff might not be stable for your linux install so be warned.
