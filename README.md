# linux-stuff

This is a collection of dotfiles and configs for my ThinkPad-T490 running linux

### Why

This is a repo for me, don't expect software or other things for linux to be developed here, it's mostly to make setup of linux on my ThinkPad-T490 easier.

In addition to that, this stuff might not be stable for your linux install so be warned.
